## Pull Requests
Pull requests are always welcome! However, please submit a PR to the `development` branch in order to keep the `master` branch match up with the `TUSKit` pod at all times.

TUSKit is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "TUSKit"

## Example Project
To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

# Usage
------
Please refrence the Example Project for usage examples while documentation is being written.


# About [tus.io](http://tus.io):
------
  Users want to share more and more photos and videos. But mobile networks are fragile. Platform APIs are a mess. Every project builds its own file uploader. A thousand one week projects that barely work, when all we need is one real project, done right.

  We are going to do this right. We will solve reliable file uploads for once and for all. A new open protocol for resumable uploads built on HTTP. Simple, cheap, reusable stacks for clients and servers. Any language, any platform, any network.

TUSKit is a ready to use tus client for iOS.
